        Save the Chicken!!!
        Sudden Earthquake tremors have made the chickens go crazy.
        Almost every chicken came back to the Hen house except one.
        The sun is getting down and cats are ready to hunt.
        Make sure the chicken goes back to the hen house safely.
        Don't even think about going nearer to the cats.
        Good Luck!
